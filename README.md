# Electric Vehicle Market Segmentation & Consumer Purchase Behavior Analysis

# Project Overview
This project focuses on market segmentation for electric vehicles (EVs) by applying various data processing and machine learning techniques. The goal is to predict different segments of EV data to better understand customer preferences and market trends.

# Data Pre-Processing

Data preprocessing is crucial for improving the quality of data and ensuring accurate results. The steps involved in preprocessing include:

-> Handling Missing Values: Checking for and addressing missing values to avoid incorrect analysis.
Removing Duplicates: Ensuring there are no duplicate records in the dataset.
Identifying Outliers: Detecting and treating outliers that may distort the model's learning process.
Data Encoding: Converting categorical data into a suitable numerical format for machine learning algorithms.
